/** \class FastMutexLock
 * \brief Critical section locking class.
 * 
 * FastMutexLock allows the locking of variables which are accessed 
 * through different threads.  This header file also defines 
 * SimpleFastMutexLock which is not a subclass of Object.
 * The API is identical to that of MutexLock, and the behavior is
 * identical as well, except on Windows 9x/NT platforms. The only difference
 * on these platforms is that MutexLock is more flexible, in that
 * it works across processes as well as across threads, but also costs
 * more, in that it evokes a 600-cycle x86 ring transition. The 
 * FastMutexLock provides a higher-performance equivalent (on 
 * Windows) but won't work across processes. Since it is unclear how,
 * in igtl, an object at the igtl level can be shared across processes
 * in the first place, one should use FastMutexLock unless one has
 * a very good reason to use MutexLock. If higher-performance equivalents
 * for non-Windows platforms (Irix, SunOS, etc) are discovered, they
 * should replace the implementations in this class
 *
 * \ingroup OSSystemObjects
